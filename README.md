# Gtropy Assignment
### 1)In order to build a dictionary to efficiently store and retrive information, I have used "TRIE" data structure
### 2)File handling mechanism has been used in order to retrieve words from the text file
### 3)As compared to other data structures, storing and retriving information from TRIE data structure is very efficient
## *Time and Space complexity analysis of Insertion into the dictionary: 
### Time Complexity : O(length(word)), where word is the string to be inserted into the dataset
### Space Complexity : O(length(word)), where word is the string to be inserted into the dataset
## *Time and Space complexity analysis of searching into the dictionary: 
### Time Complexity : O(length(word)), where word is the string to be inserted into the dataset
### Space Complexity: O(1)

## Handled Corner Cases:
### 1) If the user enters speacial letters by mistake even then the word will be searched
### 2) Irrespective of wheather the word is lowercase or uppercase, the input word will be searched correctly
